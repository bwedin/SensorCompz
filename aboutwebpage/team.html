	 	Andrew's go to weird fact about himself is that he can lick his elbow. His hobbies include climbing and singing a little too loudly in the shower. He would also really like for someone to explain to him why we can't or don't correct to 20/10 vision. </td>

	Marielle likes to play games. Here are two truths and a lie:



	<p> 1) Marielle is a chronic sleepwalker whose latest antics include checking her email at 3am, leaving her earplugs on her roommates doorknob in the middle of the night, and putting on multiple pairs of socks. </p>



	<p> 2) Marielle plays for CUT (Carleton Ultimate team), an Open D1 frisbee team. She was originally going to run D1 track, but decided to go to Carleton because of the academics. She made friends with one of the senior guys on CUT, who saw her sprint during a new student week game and recruited her to the team. She got too busy with student government to commit full time (she does have a CUT tattoo though!), but they liked her so much she gets to just come to practice occasionally and the major tournaments.</p>



	<p> 3) Marielle is going to be working at a computer security company next year, on their philosophy team (Ontology) thinking about abstractions of abstractions and working for a tool using mammal. </p>
